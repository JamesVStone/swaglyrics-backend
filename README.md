# swaglyrics-issue-maker
Server side code to make an issue on the [main repo](https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify) when the 
program encounters a song it can't fetch lyrics for. 

Works using the GitHub API and Flask.

The [main program](https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify/blob/fbe9428e3458e6cce1396133b84c229ccd974a9e/swaglyrics/cli.py#L57) is configured to send a POST request to the server.

Need to document and add unit testing.

### Rate Limits
In order to prevent spam and/or abuse of endpoints, rate limiting has been set such that it wouldn't affect a normal 
user.

Since SwagLyrics checks for track change every 5 seconds, requests on endpoints `/stripper` and `/unsupported` are 
allowed once per 5 seconds only.
